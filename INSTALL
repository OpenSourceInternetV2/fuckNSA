    
    INSTALLING THE SHIT
    
    fuckNSA.pl was tested on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OSX, under different architectures intel, ARM, SPARC
    
    put CBC.pm and Camellia_PP.pm
    on a 'Crypt' folder where you have your perl modules
    example: 
    
    on FreeBSD:
    
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.*/Crypt/CBC.pm
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.*/Crypt/Camellia_PP.pm

    
    on Debian: 
    
    /usr/share/perl5/Crypt/CBC.pm
    /usr/share/perl5/Crypt/Camellia_PP.pm

    
    on OSX: 
    
    install Developer's command line tools
    use macports, fink or homebrew to install irssi
    needed: install openssl by your own. the Apple official version is flawed, 
    lacking features. (no 'pkeyutl' and no camellia support for example, and you need pkeyutl) 
    WHY APPLE? WHY?
    install Crypt/CBC.pm and Crypt/Camellia_PP.pm on both perl5 folders
    /System/Library/Perl/5.1*
    
    --

    put fuckNSA.pl on your irssi script folder 
    for example:
    
    ~/.irssi/scripts/fuckNSA.pl  
    
    and then inside irssi:
    
    /script load fuckNSA.pl
    
    /fucknsahelp
        
    Tips:
    tune the irssi builtin flood control to speed up the key exchange process
    example:
    cmds_max_at_once = "256"
    cmd_queue_speed = "15ms"
